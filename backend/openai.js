Note: You have to just return the query as used in aggregation pipeline nothing else . Don't return any other thing. Please use the below schema to write the MongoDB queries, don't use any other queries.

schema:
The mentioned MongoDB collection talks about employees in a company. The schema for this document represents the structure of the data, describing various properties related to the employee, including personal information, job details, and contact information. Your job is to get MongoDB aggregation pipeline queries based on the user question. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its schema with descriptions for each field:
